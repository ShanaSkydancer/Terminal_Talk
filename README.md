## How to get the app
***

### The following must be installed before any further steps
***

1. [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)
2. [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
3. [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/)
4. [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/)

## Installation
***

1. Fork and clone the repository from Github

2. Go to the root folder on your computer/laptop that you've just cloned, and run `npm install`
	* This is going to download all the dependencies that you'll need because they were listed in the projects package.json file.

3. Now you can run `npm run terminal_talk` to start the app in the terminal.

## Running Tests
***

All tests can be accessed within the 'test' folder of this project.

We will be running test with:
1. Mocha
2. Travis CI

### Mocha
***

To run mocha you simply use

`mocha`

### Travis CI
***

1. Log in to Travis CI with your Github account

2. Flick your repo's switch on
	* Go to your Profile page
	* Flip the switch in the repository that you'd like to enable

3. Add a `.travis.yml` file into your project folder

4. In that file add language and version:

	```
	language: node_js
	node_js:
	    - "v8.4.0"
	````

5. You will need to go into your package.json file and set up a test script

	```
	"scripts": {
	    "test": "node_modules/.bin/mocha"
	  }
	```

6. Dont forget to push now to Github
	* Push your commit that adds .travis.yml to your repository

7. Now to run Travis you simply use

`npm test`

### Future Plans
-----------

In the future I plan to:

1. Have my code cleaner and more refactored
2. Have the program be able to deal with exceptions or invalid commands
3. Make use of a database like MongoDB
4. Write even more tests
